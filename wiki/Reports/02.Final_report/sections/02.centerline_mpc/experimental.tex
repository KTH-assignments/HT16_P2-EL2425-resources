We are not able to adequately report on the performance of this functionality;
we had successfully configured this module, but an undetermined failure
seems to have occurred in the time between this and when we returned to
record and log it. The vehicle might have suffered some mechanical
mis-calibration due to crashes it has had in the meantime. However,
this does not explain why it is able to follow the centerline with a
PID controller, since they only difference between these two functionalities
lies in code.

As evidence of the successful completion of this task, we can exhibit a
video which illustrates the performance of our approach prior to this failure.
