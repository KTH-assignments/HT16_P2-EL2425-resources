This report summarizes the work done by a group of students, namely Alexandros
Filotheou, Melih Guldogus, Tengfan Lin, Roberto Sanchez-Rey and Xuechun Xu,
at KTH under EL2425 - Automatic Control Project Course, during the winter
semester of 2016.

In it, we include the theoretical approaches to the solution of
three problems, and their respective experimental performance and results.
These problems pertain to the control of the behaviour of a F1/10 RC car:
directing and maintaining the trajectory of the vehicle at the centerline of
a virtual lane using PID and predictive control, and directing and maintaining
the trajectory of the vehicle on the circumference of a circle using
predictive control.
