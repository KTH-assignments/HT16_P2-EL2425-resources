This report summarizes the work done by a group of students, namely Alexandros
Filotheou, Melih Guldogus, Tengfan Lin, Roberto Sanchez-Rey and Xuechun Xu,
at KTH under EL2425 - Automatic Control Project Course, in 2016.

In it, we include the theoretical approaches and experimental results of
three problems pertaining to controlling the behaviour of a F1/10 RC car:
travelling on the middle of a corridor via control by PID and predictive
control, and travelling on the circumference of a circle via control by
predictive control.
