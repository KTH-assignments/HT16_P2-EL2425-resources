The main goal of this project is to gain practical knowledge and experience in
design and implementation of control systems through a smaller-sized F1 car. In
the process of achieving this goal we will learn to work effectively in a
project group, expand our knowledge in aspects of the usage of engineering tools
or methods, and increase our oral and written skills with presentations and
reports respectively.

From technical point of view, there are four goals throughout this project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Driving the car via tele-operation
  \item Achieving to drive the car to the centerline of a lane and maintaining that trajectory
  \item Driving the car in a circular trajectory as fast as possible
  \item Controlling slip at high speeds
\end{itemize}

The details about achieving these goals are given in section \ref{04} as milestones
which are the crucial points of the project.
