Autonomy of vehicles is on the rise: major automotive and technology companies
are focusing their efforts on delivering cars that can transport and navigate
themselves within real conditions.

The goal of this project is to explore and exploit the principles of Automatic
Control on the F1/10 racing car in order for it to complete a racing circuit as
quickly as possible under loss of traction. The project is carried out as part
of the course \textit{Automatic Control, Project Course} on the second period
of the academic year 2016-17 at KTH and will be hosted at KTH's Smart Mobility
Lab.

This document describes and illustrates the overall goals of the project, its
organization, its milestones and various timeframes, as well as the working
method that will be employed in order to ensure its quality.
