Since the project will last about 10 weeks, together with the collaboration,
the project management can also play an important role. To ensure the quality of
the project, the following management methods should be taken into account:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A daily meeting on the working day is required to give a short review of
    accomplishment of daily tasks, list the problems and exchange relative
    experience.
  \item A weekly meeting is organized to check the schedule progress, shortly
    summarize tasks in week unit and make a new plan when it is needed.
  \item A weekly meeting with supervisor is required, and reporting any problems
    to supervisor in time is always encouraged.
\end{itemize}

Dropbox is used to share common files, and Github for computer code. The
newest files will always be uploaded in Dropbox and Github to ensure that everyone
can see and edit it. Furthermore, this project will employ the Scrum working
methodology. To this end, Trello will be used as the means of implementing
Scrum. Simultaneously, there will be another folder for back-up,
and all files can also be found in local computers. Although Facebook and email
correspondence will be used, the members can and shall contact each other
anytime, as face to face communication is considered the most efficient way to
make a progress of project. How the meeting is organized has been stated as above.
