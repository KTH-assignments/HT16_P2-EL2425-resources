  \subsection{Theoretical solution to tracking the centerline of a lane using
    a PID controller}

    The problem can be decomposed into two separate and independent
    components involving a translation and a rotation of the vehicle.


    \textbf{Translational component}
    We assume that the pose of the vehicle at time $t$ is
    $(x_c, y_c, v_c, \psi_v)$ and that two range scans at $+90^\circ$ and
    $-90^\circ$ with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
    vehicle are available, which are denoted as $CL$ and $CR$ respectively. Also,
    in figure \ref{fig:centerline_pid_translation}, point $O'$ is a future
    reference and the angle $\lambda$ is the angle that the vehicle should
    make in order to reach $O'$ in a future moment.

    Then, since $CL + CR = L = OL + OR$ and $CL = OC + OL$, this means that

    \begin{equation}
      OC = OR - CR = \dfrac{L}{2} - CR = \dfrac{CL + CR}{2} - CR = \dfrac{CL-CR}{2}
    \end{equation}
    where $L$ is the width of the lane whose centerline the vehicle is to track.

    Furthermore, in the $CC'O'$ triangle

    \begin{align}
      \text{tan}\lambda &= \dfrac{O'C'}{CC'} = \dfrac{OC}{CC'} = \dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'} \\
      \lambda &= \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'}
    \end{align}

    The length $CC'$ is unknown and can be set beforehand. Its magnitude
    will determine the vehicle's rate of convergence to the centerline of the
    lane.

    \begin{figure}[H]\centering
      \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_pid_translation.tex}}
      \caption{The vehicle's heading angle is equal to that of the lane's.
        However, its position is off track.}
      \label{fig:centerline_pid_translation}
    \end{figure}

    The angular error of the translational component is then

    \begin{align}
      e_t &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'}
    \end{align}

    where the minus sign is introduced due to the
    convention that a left turn is assigned a negative value.

    \textbf{Rotational component}


    We assume that the the pose of the vehicle at time $t$ as
    $(x_c, y_c, v_c, \psi_v)$ and that three range scans
    at $+90^\circ$, $0^\circ$ and $-90^\circ$ with respect to the
    longitudinal axis of the vehicle are available, which are denoted as
    $CL$, $CF$ and $CR$ respectively.

    Here we can distinguish two cases: one where the vehicle is facing the right
    lane boundary and one where it is facing the left one. It is not obvious
    in this configuration where the vehicle is heading: the only available
    information so far is only the three range scans.

    In the first case, the heading angle error is

    \begin{align}
      \phi = \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}
    \end{align}

    \begin{figure}[H]\centering
      \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_pid_rotation_negative.tex}}
      \caption{The vehicle's position and its reference are equal. However,
        the vehicle's heading is off track. Its heading is towards the right
        lane boundary.}
      \label{}
    \end{figure}

    The rotational error of the vehicle in this case is

    \begin{align}
      e_r &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}
    \end{align}

    therefore the overall angular error of the vehicle in this case is

    \begin{align}
      e &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'} - \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}
    \end{align}

    where the minus signs are introduced due to the
    convention that a left turn is assigned a negative value.


    In the second case, the heading angle error is

    \begin{align}
      \phi = \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
    \end{align}

    \begin{figure}[H]\centering
      \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_pid_rotation_positive.tex}}
      \caption{The vehicle's position and its reference are equal. However,
        the vehicle's heading is off track. Its heading is towards the left
        lane boundary.}
      \label{}
    \end{figure}

    The rotational error of the vehicle in this case is

    \begin{align}
      e_r &= \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
    \end{align}

    therefore the overall angular error of the vehicle in this case is

    \begin{align}
      e &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'} + \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
    \end{align}

    where the minus sign of the translational error is introduced due to the
    convention that a left turn is assigned a negative value.


    In order to deduce the correct value of $\phi$ ($-\tan^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}$ or
    $\tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}$) further ranges scans are needed. To this end,
    a difference between ranges around point $F$ is taken: starting at the
    right of $F$ and moving anti-clockwise, we calculate the difference between
    two range scans for a given angle between them. If its sign
    is negative then the vehicle is facing the left lane boundary; if not,
    it is facing the right lane boundary. This concept is depicted in figures
    \ref{fig:range_diff_positive} and  \ref{fig:range_diff_negative}.

    \begin{figure}[H]\centering
      \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_range_differences_positive.tex}}
      \caption{$CF_0 > CF > CF_1$, hence $CF_0 - CF_1 > 0$ and $\phi = tan^{-1} \dfrac{CL}{CF}$}
      \label{fig:range_diff_positive}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[H]\centering
      \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_range_differences_negative.tex}}
      \caption{$CF_0 < CF < CF_1$, hence $CF_0 - CF_1 < 0$ and $\phi = -tan^{-1} \dfrac{CR}{CF}$}
      \label{fig:range_diff_negative}
    \end{figure}


    Since the input to the plant is in terms of angular displacement, this
    is in fact the error that the PID controller can include and utilize in
    order to determine the plant's input.

    The angular input to the vehicle will then be

    \begin{align}
      \delta = K_p \cdot e + K_d \cdot \dfrac{de}{dt} + K_i \cdot \int e dt
    \end{align}






















  \subsection{Theoretical solution to tracking the centerline of a lane using
    a MPC controller}


    In figure \ref{fig:centerline_mpc}, the $x$ axis is fixed on the lane's
    centerline, while axis $y$ is perpendicular to it. The origin is at point
    $O$. The vehicle is represented by point $C$. The orientation of the vehicle
    with respect to the lane (the $x$-axis) is $\phi$. Given this configuration
    and three scans, at $-90^{\circ}$, $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ with
    respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, denoted by $CR$, $CF$ and
    $CL$ respectively, the objective is to find the distance $OC$ and the angle
    $\phi$ so that a MPC optimization problem can be solved with $OC$ and $\phi$
    acting as initial conditions. The velocity of the vehicle,
    which is constant, and its displacement along the $x$-axis are at this point
    irrelevant to the optimization problem given this configuration. The only
    source of information is the lidar itself and nothing else.

    \begin{figure}[H]\centering
      \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_mpc.tex}}
      \caption{}
      \label{fig:centerline_mpc}
    \end{figure}


    \subsubsection{Initial conditions}

    \textbf{Finding $\phi$}

    We turn our attention to triangle LCF, where

    \begin{align}
      tan\phi &= \dfrac{CL}{CF} \Leftrightarrow \phi = tan^{-1} \dfrac{CL}{CF} \\
    \end{align}


    \textbf{Finding $OC$}

    First we note that

    \begin{align}
      L_o O + OC + CR_o &= W = CR_o + CL_o
    \end{align}

    where $W$ is the width of the lane. But $L_o O = \dfrac{W}{2}$ hence

    \begin{align}
      OC + CR_o &= \dfrac{1}{2}(CR_o + CL_o) \Leftrightarrow \\
      OC &= \dfrac{1}{2}(CL_o - CR_o)
    \end{align}

    But $CL_o = CL sin\lambda$ and $CR_o = CR cos\phi$, hence


    \begin{align}
      OC &= \dfrac{1}{2}(CL sin\lambda - CR cos\phi)
    \end{align}

    From triangle LCF we note that $\phi + \lambda + \dfrac{\pi}{2} = \pi$,
    hence $\lambda = \dfrac{\pi}{2} - \phi$. Then, we conclude that

    \begin{align}
      OC &= \dfrac{1}{2}(CL - CR) cos\phi
    \end{align}




    \subsubsection{Obtaining the relevant linearized kinematic model}

    The model constitutes the equations of motion of the vehicle, and has two
    states ($y$ and $\phi$) and one input ($\delta$). The equations of the
    vehicle's motion that are relevant here are

    \begin{align}
      \dot{y} &= v sin(\phi + \beta) \\
      \dot{\phi} &= \dfrac{v}{l_r} sin\beta
    \end{align}

    Sampling with a sampling time of $T_s$ gives

    \begin{align}
      y_{k+1} &= y_{k} + T_s v sin(\phi_k + \beta_k) \\
      \phi_{k+1} &= \phi_{k} + T_s \dfrac{v}{l_r} sin\beta_k
    \end{align}

    where

    \begin{align}
      \beta_k = tan^{-1}\Big(\dfrac{l_r}{l_r + l_f} tan\delta_k\Big)
    \end{align}


    Forming the Jacobians for matrices $A$, $B$ and evaluating them at time
    $t=k$ around $\delta = 0$ (which makes $\beta = 0$) gives

    \begin{equation}
     A =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & T_s v cos(\phi + \beta) \\\\
        0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & T_s v cos\Big(tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL_k}{CF_k} + tan^{-1} (l_q tan\delta_k)\Big) \\
        0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
     A =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & T_s v cos\Big(tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL_k}{CF_k}\Big) \\\\
        0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
     B =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        T_s v cos(\phi + \beta) \dfrac{l_q}{l_q^2 sin^2\delta_k + cos^2\delta_k} \\
        \dfrac{T_s v}{l_r} cos(\beta) \dfrac{l_q}{l_q^2 sin^2\delta_k + cos^2\delta_k}
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        T_s v cos\Big(tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL_k}{CF_k} + tan^{-1} (l_q tan\delta_k)\Big) \dfrac{l_q}{l_q^2 sin^2\delta_k + cos^2\delta_k} \\
        \dfrac{T_s v}{l_r} cos\Bigg(tan^{-1} \Big(l_q tan\delta_k\Big)\Bigg) \dfrac{l_q}{l_q^2 sin^2\delta_k + cos^2\delta_k}
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
     B =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \dfrac{T_s l_r v}{l_r + l_f} cos\Big(tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL_k}{CF_k}\Big) \\\\
        \dfrac{T_s v}{l_r+l_f}
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    where $l_q = \dfrac{l_r}{l_r + l_f}$




  Now we can express the linear model as

    \begin{align}
      s_{k+1} = A s_k + B \delta_k
    \end{align}

    where

    \begin{equation}
      s=
      \begin{bmatrix}
        y_{k} \\
        \phi_{k}
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    or

    \begin{equation}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        y_{k+1} \\
        \phi_{k+1}
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & T_s v cos\Big(tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL_k}{CF_k}\Big) \\\\
        0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        y_{k} \\
        \phi_{k}
      \end{bmatrix}
      +
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \dfrac{T_s l_r v}{l_r + l_f} cos\Big(tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL_k}{CF_k}\Big) \\\\
        \dfrac{T_s v}{l_r+l_f}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \delta_{k}
    \end{equation}

    \subsubsection{Stating the optimization problem}

    We can now form the optimization problem as

    \begin{align}
      \text{minimize }    & \sum\limits_{k=0}^N y_k^2 q_y + \phi_k^2 q_{\phi} + \delta_k^2 r \\
      \text{subject to }  & s_{k+1} = A s_k + B \delta_k,\text{ where } s_k = [y_k, \phi_k]^T \\
                          & \delta_{min} \leq \delta_k \leq \delta_{max} \\
                          & y_0 = -\dfrac{1}{2}(CL-CR)cos\phi_0 \\
                          & \phi_0 = tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
    \end{align}
