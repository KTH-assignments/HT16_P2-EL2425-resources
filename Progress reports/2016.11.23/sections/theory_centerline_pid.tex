The problem can be decomposed into two separate and independent
components involving a translation and a rotation of the vehicle.


\textbf{Translational component}
We assume that the pose of the vehicle at time $t$ is
$(x_c, y_c, v_c, \psi_v)$ and that two range scans at $+90^\circ$ and
$-90^\circ$ with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
vehicle are available, which are denoted as $CL$ and $CR$ respectively. Also,
in figure \ref{fig:centerline_pid_translation}, point $O'$ is a future
reference and the angle $\lambda$ is the angle that the vehicle should
make in order to reach $O'$ in a future moment.

Then, since $CL + CR = L = OL + OR$ and $CL = OC + OL$, this means that

\begin{equation}
  OC = OR - CR = \dfrac{L}{2} - CR = \dfrac{CL + CR}{2} - CR = \dfrac{CL-CR}{2}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the width of the lane whose centerline the vehicle is to track.

Furthermore, in the $CC'O'$ triangle

\begin{align}
  \text{tan}\lambda &= \dfrac{O'C'}{CC'} = \dfrac{OC}{CC'} = \dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'} \\
  \lambda &= \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'}
\end{align}

The length $CC'$ is unknown and can be set beforehand. Its magnitude
will determine the vehicle's rate of convergence to the centerline of the
lane.

  \caption{The vehicle's heading angle is equal to that of the lane's.
    However, its position is off track.}
  \label{fig:centerline_pid_translation}
\end{figure}

The angular error of the translational component is then

\begin{align}
  e_t &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'}
\end{align}

where the minus sign is introduced due to the
convention that a left turn is assigned a negative value.

\textbf{Rotational component}


We assume that the the pose of the vehicle at time $t$ as
$(x_c, y_c, v_c, \psi_v)$ and that three range scans
at $+90^\circ$, $0^\circ$ and $-90^\circ$ with respect to the
longitudinal axis of the vehicle are available, which are denoted as
$CL$, $CF$ and $CR$ respectively.

Here we can distinguish two cases: one where the vehicle is facing the right
lane boundary and one where it is facing the left one. It is not obvious
in this configuration where the vehicle is heading: the only available
information so far is only the three range scans.

In the first case, the heading angle error is

\begin{align}
  \phi = \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_pid_rotation_negative.tex}}
  \caption{The vehicle's position and its reference are equal. However,
    the vehicle's heading is off track. Its heading is towards the right
    lane boundary.}
  \label{}
\end{figure}

The rotational error of the vehicle in this case is

\begin{align}
  e_r &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}
\end{align}

therefore the overall angular error of the vehicle in this case is

\begin{align}
  e &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'} - \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}
\end{align}

where the minus signs are introduced due to the
convention that a left turn is assigned a negative value.


In the second case, the heading angle error is

\begin{align}
  \phi = \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_pid_rotation_positive.tex}}
  \caption{The vehicle's position and its reference are equal. However,
    the vehicle's heading is off track. Its heading is towards the left
    lane boundary.}
  \label{}
\end{figure}

The rotational error of the vehicle in this case is

\begin{align}
  e_r &= \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
\end{align}

therefore the overall angular error of the vehicle in this case is

\begin{align}
  e &= -\text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL-CR}{2CC'} + \text{tan}^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}
\end{align}

where the minus sign of the translational error is introduced due to the
convention that a left turn is assigned a negative value.


In order to deduce the correct value of $\phi$ ($-\tan^{-1}\dfrac{CR}{CF}$ or
$\tan^{-1}\dfrac{CL}{CF}$) further ranges scans are needed. To this end,
a difference between ranges around point $F$ is taken: starting at the
right of $F$ and moving anti-clockwise, we calculate the difference between
two range scans for a given angle between them. If its sign
is negative then the vehicle is facing the right lane boundary; if not,
it is facing the left lane boundary. This concept is depicted in figures
\ref{fig:range_diff_positive} and  \ref{fig:range_diff_negative}.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_range_differences_positive.tex}}
  \caption{$CF_0 > CF > CF_1$, hence $CF_0 - CF_1 > 0$ and $\phi = tan^{-1} \dfrac{CL}{CF}$}
  \label{fig:range_diff_positive}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
  \scalebox{1}{\input{./figures/centerline_range_differences_negative.tex}}
  \caption{$CF_0 < CF < CF_1$, hence $CF_0 - CF_1 < 0$ and $\phi = -tan^{-1} \dfrac{CR}{CF}$}
  \label{fig:range_diff_negative}
\end{figure}


Since the input to the plant is in terms of angular displacement, this
is in fact the error that the PID controller can include and utilize in
order to determine the plant's input.

The angular input to the vehicle will then be

\begin{align}
  \delta = K_p \cdot e + K_d \cdot \dfrac{de}{dt} + K_i \cdot \int e dt
\end{align}
